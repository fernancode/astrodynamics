# astrodynamics
Fundamentals of Astrodynamics equations, plots, and visualizations. Code was made from content learned from AE412 Space Systems class at O.S.U. and Fundamentals of Astrodynamics textbook.

Running 
```
plot_orbit(h,e,22.5)
```
where h is angular momentum and e is orbit eccentricity returns a graphic representing that satelling orbit.

Running
```
orbit_eq(h,e,theta)
```
where angular momentum, eccentricity, and theta are known, returns radius of the satellite from the body.
